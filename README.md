This is a demo of showing how to use restful Api with react.

The Api used in this demo is the Hacker News search Api (link: http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=)  

# Included features are:
1. A search box for users to type in and search: 
After the user click the 'Seacrh' button or press enter in the input, a table will be displayed to show the results.
The table will only show at most 10 results.
2. A 'Delete' button attached to each result for user to delete the result.
3. A 'Load more' for user to click and look through more results (only if there are more results).
